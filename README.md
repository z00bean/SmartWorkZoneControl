# SmartWorkZoneControl-MassDOT

https://www.mass.gov/doc/smart-work-zone-control-and-performance-evaluation-based-on-trajectory-data

This research project aims to develop methods to extract vehicle trajectories;, use the trajectories to analyze driver behavior, particularly lane-changing behavior under different conditions, and identify safety hazards and opportunities to improve work zone safety and operations. (MassDOT Research Program with funding from FHWA SPR funds.)

(Additional information and sample results will be added soon.)
