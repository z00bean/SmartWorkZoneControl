# SmartWorkZoneControl-MassDOT
This research project aims to develop methods to extract vehicle trajectories;, use the trajectories to analyze driver behavior, particularly lane-changing behavior under different conditions, and identify safety hazards and opportunities to improve work zone safety and operations.
