For traffic data analysis, we employed ultra-high-definition (UHD) radar and FLIR TrafiSense AI-632 thermal imaging cameras. The UHD radar, a forward-firing sensor, offers enhanced detection and tracking capabilities over traditional side-firing radars, capable of monitoring vehicles across a 1,000-foot road segment. Despite the preference for overhead mounting to observe lane-specific vehicle trajectories, practical constraints necessitated roadside deployment. (To address this, a clustering algorithm was developed to classify the radar data by lanes, aiding in the analysis of speed variations approaching highway work zones.)

The thermal cameras, mounted on roadside trailers and a boom lift, provided robust data collection at night, overcoming poor lighting challenges. These cameras, with a resolution of 640x480 pixels, were chosen for their balance of performance and cost, allowing for effective night-time observation of driver behavior in work zones. Operating with an average power consumption of 10.5W, peaking at 15W, these systems were instrumental in the collection efforts from May 9 to May 25 in Medford, involving five cameras strategically placed for optimal coverage. Two radar systems were installed at both the Medford and Danvers locations.
